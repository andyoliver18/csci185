												<h2>Giving a new definition of a multimedia artist</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/paint.png" alt="image of Andy Oliver" /></span>
											<h3>The Road to success was never easy</h3>
											<p>Growing up in south east San Diego, in a particular area that was nicknamed "The Dip" for its sloped
											streets and low income apartments, Andy had to work hard make it. He grew up in the Church but is currently
											not a Christian but loves gospel music. For a time, he would play competetive basketball at his local
											recreation center saying, "The rec centers raised me. It ignited my competetive spirit, allowed me to make friends
											with people of different cultures, and I learned how to hold my own." Andy later stopped playing sports competitively
											during his middle school years due to injuries and near fights that would happen on the court. "It was too much,"
											Andy would say. "I just want to focus on my art and make a solid living for myself."
											
											</p>
											<p>He was fortunate to get accepted an art centered elementary school, where he was able to
												excel in various forms of arts such as viola, piano, charcoal sketching, and even mural painting. 
												Although he stopped playing musical instruments in middle school,  In high school, Andy focused on digital 
												and tradional art, and made a living selling portrait commissions as a senior. He also won an award at
												the San Diego County Fair in 2019, for his colored pencil piece of Poseidon in a fish bowl. 
											</p>
											<h3>The Music</h3>
											<p>Andy has always had an ear for music, and knew what songs go well together. This lead him to
												becoming interested in DJing and songwriting. He started to practice music mixing in the summer of 2022
											but had to stop due to unforseen circumstances. Now Andy is back to mixing music and is even in process
										of having live DJ streams. </p>
											
										</p>
											<h3>A healer and Motivator</h3>
											<p>Andy is now studying to be a Public Health nurse so he can provide medical needs
											 to the black, latinx, and LGBT community. He considers himself a healer as he has always 
											 been able to help people who need it the most, and his art provides a remedy
											 for those who see it.
